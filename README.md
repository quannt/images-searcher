## Motivation

An images searcher that uses Unsplash API under the hood. There are two pages: search page (default route), and favorite (/favorite).

## Tech

- [Nuxtjs]
- [Vuejs]
- [TailwindCSS]

* Nuxt's philosophy is convention over configuration which means the application is already fined tune to a certain extend, this speeds up the development time.
* Server side rendering is always nice to have for better time to interactive and SEO purpose.
* Favorites are persisted in local storage for simplicity.

## TODO

- [ ] Make list title and description editable.
- [ ] Use [content loader] for images.
- [ ] Use [srcset] for better responsiveness.
- [ ] Lazy load off-screen images. (https://web.dev/lazy-loading/).
- [ ] Testing.
- [ ] Handle race conditions on the search bar properly (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWZj56qUNfs).
- [ ] Add links to switch between home page and favorites page.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```

The application is automatically deployed to [Vercel] on all commits to the `main` branch.
